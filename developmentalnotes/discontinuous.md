# DEVELOPMENTAL NOTES

```
:: :. .. . .. .: :: 2023_02_06 :: :. .. . .. .: ::

I HAVE LOST THE LAST GUIDE I MADE FOR THIS which is a real shame since it had a whole
ASCII art banner of minmo (yes the SH3 poster) and cici (idrc how this name came about)
but ive also decided im going to take today to at least upload some blank-ish files to
encourage note taking again. my memory is pretty bad and the motivation is low but if
yknow i make time to actually work on the games i want to make between classes, it both
scratches a long exisiting itch of mine and pads my resume real nice.

anyway, i'm hoping i'll be able to dredge up the old file since i had a cool collection
of notes in there... and also a pre-established style guide to follow for these text files. 
but, it's all jazz anyway

no luck on the hunt for my old notes so i guess we're starting from scratch here. but,
on the brightside, i have something better: gifs from the first draft of this game! yippie!

this first one we have here is the original title screen:

```
rough-ish art aside, i'm pretty proud of the composition here. nevermind that the game
barely functioned. but, to my credit, it was my first time working with C# and the teacher
has a very "hands off" style of learning where you either sink or swim. personally, i think
given that i cobbled this together with 0 understanding of the language i was coding it in,
it's a miracle it functioned. and it did! the movement worked! the background moved how
i wanted it to! i had a whole box and button combo that i coded! VERY proud of that box
and button.
```
![said box and button](https://i.imgur.com/0E1AMy5.gif)

```
something i want to try with these games i make is making all the assets from scratch myself.
even with this "rough concept" here, all the art was done by me (except the box i think? 
not sure why i didnt just draw one up.), the font was made by me (its on this very github!),
the few sound effects i put in the game were recorded through my microphone. i was on my way!
everything but the player controls were coded by me. the code that makes the character stretch 
while jumping was a script someone else posted. i wish i was that good. i WANT to be that good.

(i feel really bad that i can't remember who posted the script but i promise the second
i find the source, i will link it here.)

alright, moving on. the plot of the game, since i didn't type that out last time. 
of all the games, this one is the most personal and feels kinda "woe is me" explaining it 
so sorry if it comes across that way. 😔 

i came up with this game in 2019. i was going through a rough time working a night shift at 
a factory and it was a very isolating experience since all the people i wanted to hang out with 
weren't awake when i was. i was knee-deep in the middle of a solid year of not eating above 800 
calories a day and my main way to deal with depression / stress is just... sleep. sleeping through it. 
you can't be miserable if you're passed out! i spent a damn good chunk of my teenage years asleep for
the same reason.

something weird about that job, despite the massive amount of down time i had during those shifts
(im talking in the 8 hour shifts, i had 2 hours of work. max.), they wouldn't let me read or do 
anything on my phone. but, for some reason, they were cool with me bringing in a journal to draw in.
i had already decided that making games was something i wanted to do at this point so, whenever i
couldn't think of something to draw, i drew out levels for a platformer. i wrote down plot points,
dialogue, moves and psuedocode for those moves. (though it was before i went back to school for coding
so heavy on the pseudo).

so, quick summery is you're lucid dreaming, having a fantastic time with your bird friend
that you've made and your whole quest is going deep into your subconcious and destroying the
root of your nightmares. and, yknow what, if you want the game to be that, it can be that! there's
no need to trigger the b-side of it. but, there is a b-side. and in order to access it, you need 
to find some way to wake yourself up, which your cici (bird) is keen on not letting you do. 
but, once awake, you get to explore the characters surroundings and kind of piece together 
that they're not doing the best. the more you wake them up, the more years have passed and the more
you can see how downhill of a slope their mental health has taken. (and continues to take)

where the name comes from kind of covers a bunch of different ideas. the 'continuous' part
is how mental illness like that feels endless and all consuming. it just won't end. the only
relief minmo can find is sleep. it's continuing telling themselves that they just need to get through
one more day of things being how they are before something needs to change. 'discontinuous' is how you 
see glimpses of the player characters life. it's the gaps in memory commonly associated with 
depression. its the patches of relief the character gets with not having to deal with responsibilites 
they physically cannot handle. the world created for them in their dreams is made to be easy to 
understand. it gives them something they can actually achieve and everything is black and white 
to makes them feel like they're making the right choices.

'continuous' was also going to be the gameplay style. i was going to try and figure out how to make
the game procedurally generate more and more puzzles so it really could just go on and on forever.
but, i don't think that'll be in the "story mode" of the game. maybe a seperate mode.

though, the more the player character is awoken throughout the game, the more their life seeps
into their dreams. characters you've seen before become distorted, the levels are not as
bright and cheery as they once were. the player character is becoming unable to hide from 
their reality.

tl;dr the player character cannot deal with their depression in a constructive way. 
i'm really not trying to pull a switcharoo with the art style getting all scary all the sudden. 
not the effect i'm going for. i'm more trying to convey that the person you're playing as 
is hiding from their problems and not actually trying to fix them. they don't know how. 
they're just kind of hanging out in this limbo of disconnection from their body and doing
their very best to not turn to a more permanent solution.

anyway, i'm gonna wrap this up. my cat wants me to go to bed and keeps jumping on my shoulders
and sinking her very, VERY sharp claws into my shoulders while she falls and it hurts like absolute hell.
but, i write all this out not as a reflection of my own life (though i'd be a liar if i said 
i didnt think this game is going to be cathartic to make), but more to try and get my ideas
for it down and explain my perspective of it. if anyone plays it and gets some other message from
it that resonates with them, by all means i encourage them to hold onto that meaning. 

again, that is if i manage to actually make the damn thing. 

ok, my cat has the "im gonna jump on you" look in her eyes. im calling it here.
until next time 👋

2023_03_01 ADDITION:
not worthy of it's own chunk, but something else i was excited about is the level design.
minmo keeps traveling downward so you'd start in the clouds, make your way down until you
get to a deep, deep, deep cave. but, also, it was all lucid dreaming so incorporating like 
some fun brain wrinkles into the walls or synapses firing off in a field to mimic fireflies.
y'know, all sorts of fun stuff like that.

alright. that's all 👍
