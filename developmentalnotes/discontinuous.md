DEVELOPMENTAL NOTES

:: :. .. . .. .: :: 2023_02_06 :: :. .. . .. .: ::

I HAVE LOST THE LAST GUIDE I MADE FOR THIS which is a real shame since it had a whole
ASCII art banner of minmo (yes the SH3 poster) and cici (idrc how this name came about)
but ive also decided im going to take today to at least upload some blank-ish files to
encourage note taking again. my memory is pretty bad and the motivation is low but if
yknow i make time to actually work on the games i want to make between classes, it both
scratches a long exisiting itch of mine and pads my resume real nice.

anyway, i'm hoping i'll be able to dredge up the old file since i had a cool collection
of notes in there... and also a pre-established style guide to follow for these text files. 
but, it's all jazz anyway
```

no luck on the hunt for my old notes so i guess we're starting from scratch here. but,
on the brightside, i have something better: gifs from the first draft of this game! yippie!

this first one we have here is the original title screen:

```
rough-ish art aside, i'm pretty proud of the composition here. nevermind that the game
barely functioned. but, to my credit, it was my first time working with C# and the teacher
has a very "hands off" style of learning where you either sink or swim. personally, i think
given that i cobbled this together with 0 understanding of the language i was coding it in,
it's a miracle it functioned. and it did! the movement worked! the background moved how
i wanted it to! i had a whole box and button combo that i coded! VERY proud of that box
and button.
```
![said box and button](https://i.imgur.com/0E1AMy5.gif)

```
everything but the player controls were coded by me. the code that makes the character stretch 
while jumping was a script someone else posted. i wish i was that good. i WANT to be that good. 

alright, so... i don't know how to explain the plot without sounding dumb. (implying that the
other ones i've outline haven't.) but, uh, i came up with this game in 2019. i was going
through a rough time working a night shift and it was a very isolating experience
since all the people i wanted to hang out with weren't awake when i was. i was knee-deep in
the middle of a solid year of not eating above 800 calories a day but, my main
way to deal with depression / stress is just... sleep. sleeping through it. you can't be
miserable if you're passed out! i spent a damn good chunk of my teenage years asleep for
the same reason.

so, the whole plot is you're lucid dreaming, having a fantastic time with your bird friend
that you've made and your whole quest is going deep into your subconcious and destroying the
root of your nightmares. and, yknow what, if you want the game to be that, it can be that! there's
no need to trigger the b-side of it, but in order to access it, you kind of need to find some
way to wake yourself up. then you get to explore the characters surroundings and kind of 
piece together that they're not doing the best. 

where the name comes from kind of covers a bunch of different ideas. the 'continuous' part
is how mental illness like that feels endless and all consuming. it just won't end. the only
relief you can find is sleep. 'discontinuous' is how you see glimpses of the player characters life. 
it's the gaps in memory commonly associated with depression. its the patches of relief the character
gets with not having to deal with responsibilites they physically cannot handle. the world created 
for them in their dreams is made to be easy to understand. it gives them something they can actually 
achieve and everything is black and white to makes them feel like they're making the right choices.

though, the more the player character is awoken throughout the game, the more it seeps
into their dreams. characters you've seen before become distorted, the levels are not as
bright and cheery as they once were. the player character is becoming unable to hide from 
their reality.

tl;dr the player character cannot deal with their depression in a constructive way. 
i'm really not trying to pull a switcharoo with the art style getting all scary all the sudden. 
not the effect i'm going for. i'm more trying to convey that the person you're playing as 
is hiding from their problems and not actually trying to fix them. they don't know how. 
they're just kind of hanging out in this limbo of disconnection from their body and doing
their very best to not turn to a more permanent solution.

anyway, i'm gonna wrap this up. my cat wants me to go to bed and keeps jumping on my shoulders
and sinking her very, VERY sharp claws into my shoulders while she falls and it hurts like absolute hell.
but, i write all this out not as a reflection of my own life (though i'd be a liar if i said 
i didnt think this game is going to be cathartic to make), but more to try and get my ideas
for it down and explain my perspective of it. if anyone plays it and gets some other message from
it that resonates with them, by all means i encourage them to hold onto that meaning. 

again, that is if i manage to actually make the damn thing. 

ok, my cat has the "im gonna jump on you" look in her eyes. im calling it here.
until next time ðŸ‘‹
